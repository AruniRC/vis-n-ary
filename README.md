# vis-n-ary
Personal reading group formed by students from UMass vision+graphics labs. 
This is more for tutorial-style presentation on topics than discussing single papers.

Along with the recent developments, we hope to re-visit the classic papers in the field from time-to-time.

## Topic 1: GAN/VAE

#### Materials:
- Seminal paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf
- Convolutional GANs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf
- Tips for training GANs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf
- Best results so far on image generation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10717.pdf
- If you feel adventurous, there is finally a convergence proof on GANs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08500.pdf


## Topic 2 (tentative list): 
- Revision/bootcamp on basic continuous optimization
- Hands-on with the recent [Tensorflow Object Detector API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection)
